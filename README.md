# Custom-Triangular-QR-Syle-Encoder-Decoder

##Overview

This project explores a custom text-to-image encoding scheme inspired by QR codes, using triangular geometric patterns instead of square modules. The goal was to understand how symbolic visual encoding works and why real-world robustness (like rotation, noise, and perspective distortion) makes QR decoding non-trivial.
